PROJECT: AI BACKGROUND REMOVER (PHASE 1)
DEVELOPER: HARSHAL
ARCHITECTURE: MODULAR (LOGIC SEPARATED FROM UI)

--- FOLDER STRUCTURE ---
/My-BG-Project
  ├── /utils
  │     └── image_logic.py  <-- The "Engine" (AI Math)
  ├── app.py                <-- The "Dashboard" (UI/Website)
  └── assets/               <-- Storage for images

--- HOW THE LOGIC WORKS ---
1. INPUT: User uploads a selfie via Streamlit uploader.
2. CONVERSION: Image is converted into raw 'bytes' data.
3. AI ENGINE (U2-Net): The 'rembg' library scans the bytes, identifies the 
   human subject, and changes all background pixels to 0% opacity.
4. UI FEEDBACK: Streamlit shows a side-by-side view.
5. EXPORT: Processed image is converted back to PNG for download.

--- REQUIRED LIBRARIES ---
pip install streamlit rembg pillow onnxruntime
